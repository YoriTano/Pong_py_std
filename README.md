# Pong_py_std

Welcome to the Pong_py_std project! This project implements a classic Pong game using Python, `std`, and `stdio`.

## Features

- Classic Pong gameplay
- Player vs Player mode
- Simple and intuitive controls

## Technologies Used

- Python
- `stddraw` for graphics
- `stdio` for input/output

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YoriTano/Pong_py_std.git
    cd Pong_py_std
    ```

2. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. This project is compatible with Python 3.x.

3. Install the required dependencies. You need to have `std` and `stdio` modules available. These modules are part of the standard library for some educational purposes, but you might need to download them from your course website or repository.

## Running the Game

To start the game, run the `pong_game.py` file:

```bash
python pong_game.py
